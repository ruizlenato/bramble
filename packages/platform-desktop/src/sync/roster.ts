// Ongoing device sync: keeping this vault in step with its group after enrollment.
//
// Enrollment (../sync/transport) gets a second device in once. This is what runs afterwards:
// a roster-authenticated mesh session that exchanges entry payloads and merges them into the
// local blob. Runs while unlocked and enrolled, stops on lock, because the VEK lives in the
// Rust process and a merge cannot decrypt anything without it.
//
// Almost everything here is pinning of one kind or another, and all of it descends from issue
// #27: one process-global VEK plus several vaults means a merge that reads one vault and
// writes another produces a file whose slots wrap a key that cannot open it. Neither the master
// password nor the recovery code recovers from that. So a session is bound to a single vault
// id for its whole life, merges are serialised, and a merge that outlives its session is
// dropped rather than written.
